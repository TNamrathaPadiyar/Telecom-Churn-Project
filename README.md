# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom company using Python and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to identify key factors that drive customer churn and provide insights that can help improve customer retention.

## Dataset

- Customers with short tenure are more likely to churn.
- Churned customers tend to have higher monthly charges.
- Gender does not significantly impact churn behavior.
- Long-term contracts reduce the likelihood of churn.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## Report
A detailed PDF report with all visualizations and explanations is included in the repository.
